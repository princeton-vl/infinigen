# Docker

Run Infinigen through a Docker container.

## Linux

Install the Docker Engine by following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

Install dependency

```
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
```


In `/infinigen/`, run

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

Infinigen should now be correctly setup in the container. Use `exit` to exit the container and `docker exec -it infinigen bash` to re-enter the container as needed.

Alternatively, to run Infinigen without GPU passthrough in the Docker container, run `bash make_docker.sh --noGPU` instead of `bash make_docker.sh`. This will disable OpenGL-enabled features such as the OpenGL ground truth, but scene generation will still work.

## Windows

Ensure that you have correctly set up and configued the WSL2 environment as decsribed in the [Windows setup instructions](http://infinigen.org/docs/installation/intro).

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and make sure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine ..." is enabled in Settings. Keep the Docker Desktop application open while running containers.

Then in `/infinigen/`,

```
cd docker
```

```
bash make_docker.sh
```

Alternatively, to run Infinigen without GPU passthrough in the Docker container, run `bash make_docker.sh --noGPU` instead of `bash make_docker.sh`. This will disable OpenGL-enabled features such as the OpenGL ground truth, but scene generation will still work.

In Docker Desktop, you should see that there is now an active container. Run

```
docker exec -it infinigen bash
```

```
source setup.sh
```

Infinigen should now be correctly setup in the container. Use `exit` to exit the container and `docker exec -it infinigen bash` to re-enter the container as needed.

## Apple Silicon (M1/M2)

Infinigen does not support containers for Apple Silicon devices due to issues in Docker's emulation of x86 architecture.
